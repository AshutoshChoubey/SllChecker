## About SSL Checker Example

This is the example where We used  https://github.com/spatie/ssl-certificate pakage .
<li>Demo link :http://phoenixhub.co.in/ashutosh/sllchecker/public   </li>
In this project I used Laravel 5.8 . You can see the laravel documentation for  more detail.
Don't forget to run the <pre>php artisan key:generate</pre> command which will generate an application (encryption) key and add it to the .env file.
Just open an editor and create an .env file. Its a simple Text File.

And its ignored by git, because it contains sensitive data.

Edit: Normally there should be an .env.example file it the folder (which is not ignored by git by default), you can rename it to .env

Then <pre>run composer update</pre>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
